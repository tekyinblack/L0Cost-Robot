This folder contains the fifth iteration after migrating from the collaborative warehouse project.
This version contains communication to the local sub processor as well as the initial 
video processing for line and blob detection.
It also contains processing for use in PiWars 2024 as a subprocessor. This is in a separate Pico.ino file 
which can be omitted.
