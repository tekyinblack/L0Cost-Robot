// If present, the Main.txt file will be executed after the Startup.txt file
// once executed, control is returned to the command interface
//
// The following commands are typical of what might be placed in this file
// All the camera control commands in Startup.txt are also valid
//
// The first two commands set the default servo positions for the servos attached
// to GPIO12 and 13
// process servo command LSxxQ
//   S indicates that this is a servo command
//   xx = gpio 12 or 13, the pin the servo is attached to
//   Q is one of the following command letters
//
//   C indicates that the servo moves to the set default centre position (set as 90 in the code)
//     command layout LSxxC
//
//   A indicates that the servo moves to an absolute position indicated by the value zzzz
//     command layout LSxxAzzzz
//
//   I indicates that the servo angle will be adjusted by adding the value zzzz to the current servo angle
//     command layout LSxxIzzzz
//
//   D indicates a default value being processed
//     command layout LSxxQyzzzzaaaa
//   y can be one of M, where zzzz represents the default centre position
//                   X, where zzzz represents the default maximum servo angle
//                   T, where zzzz represnts the signal tiing for zero degress rotation
//                         and aaaa is the signal timing for maximum rotation
