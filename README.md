# L0Cost-Robot
This repository holds code for the L0Cost robot project which aims to create designs for robots which don't exceed $20. Inevitably this limit will get broken, but the limit will only increase with general inflation, not wild spending budgets!
The current target platform is the ESP32-CAM board as it provides a good mix of faclities without needing modification. The aim is not to make this platform totally autonomous, but to place control elsewhere such that, say, it might be controlled from a program on a PC or tablet, and as such be controlled in conjunction with other robots.

It is also fully expected that the basic platform wil be augmented with a co-processor to handle more extensive I/O operations
