These are demonstration programs for grippers using SG90 or MG90 servos
They are to setup the servo to 90 degrees to aid assembly, move the servo between 70 and 120
degrees to test operation, and a program to grip objects, either with feedback from the servo
or from metal contacts in the arms detecting the conductivity of the object being gripped.
